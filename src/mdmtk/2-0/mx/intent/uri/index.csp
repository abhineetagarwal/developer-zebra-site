This parm allows you to specify a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that identifies the primary data for the Intent. A URI parm is not required unless there is some primary data to be processed by the operation requested by the Intent. A URI typically identifies a resource on a remote server. In most cases, a MIME Type should also be specified to define the type of the data referenced by the URI.

Parm value input rules:
