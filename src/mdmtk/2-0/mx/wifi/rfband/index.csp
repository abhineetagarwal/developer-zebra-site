Specifies the 802.11 band(s) to use. The bands to use will usually be determined automatically through negotiation with the Wi-Fi infrastructure. However, in some cases, the Wi-Fi infrastructure may be shared amongst multiple uses, which may mean that it would be preferable to limit the devices to one band and leave the other bands for other purposes.
