This enables encryption of the Key. 

A Key, or the Passphrase used to generate a Key, is generally considered sensitive information since possession of the key for a network grants access to that network. Since the Key or Passphrase must be embedded within the XML, it is often desirable to encrypt the Key or Passphrase so it cannot be extracted and exploited if the XML is intercepted. The WPA Mode and the Key Type, which were previously specified, will determine what type of Key or Passphrase will need to be used. The value selected for the ProtectKey parm will deterime whether the Key or Passphrase will be specified in clear, unencrypted text or encrypted form.
