When using an EAP type that has a secure tunnel over which authentication credentials can be delivered, it may be necessary to specify an Identity outside the tunnel as well as an Identity inside the tunnel. To protect the actual Identity from disclosure when sending it outside the tunnel, an Anonymous Identity can be sent outside the tunnel and the actual Identity, along with the password or other verifying credentials, can be sent inside the tunnel.

If no Anonymous Identity is specified, then the actual Identity will be sent outside the tunnel, if required. This may not be a problem since the password or other verifying credentials is only sent inside the tunnel, in modes that use a tunnel for secure credential delivery. So, using the actual Identity outside the tunnel would only risk disclosure of part of the information needed to authenticate. A separate Anonymous Identity can only be used if the Authentication Server is set up to support such use.

Specifying an empty (length of zero) value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will cause the Anonymous Identity will not be set.
