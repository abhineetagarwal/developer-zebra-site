Some Zebra Android devices provide the ability to turn the Touch Panel on and off from the Power Key Menu. Turning off the Touch Panel could be useful in situations where the device screen may come in contact with foreign objects, to prevent inadvertent activation of functions via the Touch Panel.

This parm allows you to select whether or not the Touch Panel should be allowed to be turned on or off from the Touch Panel menu option in the Power Key Menu.
