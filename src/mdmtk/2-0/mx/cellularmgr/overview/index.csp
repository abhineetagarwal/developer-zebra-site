The CellularMgr controls the way a device's Cellular data connection is used.

The CellularMgr is supported only on Zebra Android devices that are equipped with Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN) adapters that enable access to a Cellular data network.

**Note:** If a device does not have a Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN) network adapter, it will not support the Cellular data connections and hence will not support the CellularMgr. Attempting to use the CellularMgr on such a device will cause an error to be returned in the Result XML document.

The CellularMgr provides the ability to change the state of various options to On or Off, thus controlling whether the capabilities are available. The CellularMgr also can enable or disable use of the same options. Disabled options cannot be turned On or Off manually by the device user or programatically using the CellularMgr. 

An option's "State" can be thought of as an "On/Off" switch; the feature is available to programs or the device user to enable or disable at will. To extend the example, "Usage" would be like a cover over the switch, usurping all access. When Usage of an option has been set, the cover is closed, and the position of the switch cannot be changed.

In Android, the Data Roaming Option determines whether a device is allowed to communicate over Cellular data networks other than the one provided by its configured "home" mobile operator. Communicating over such "foreign" networks is called roaming and can be quite convenient, allowing a device user to operate seamlessly in many different locations. But, depending on the networks involved and the terms of a specific Cellular data service plan, turning on the Data Roaming Option significantly increase telecom expenses. Turning off the Data Roaming Option can help limit such costs but limiting Cellular data connections to the "home" network.

In Android, the Background Data Option determines whether applications that are capable of performing communications in the background (i.e. while they are not the current visible running foreground application) should do so over a Cellular data network. Turning on the Background Data Option allows background communications over a Cellular data network and can improve the experience of the device user by allowing applications to have data ready "when you ask for it". For example, an email application might download emails while the device user is using another application or when the device's screen is turned off. Turning off the Background Data Option tells applications to utilize Cellular data connections only when running in the foreground.
