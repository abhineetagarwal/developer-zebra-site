The GprsMgr administers Access Point Name (APN) settings for the GPRS network used by the device.

Devices equipped with Wireless Wide Area Networks (WWAN or Cellular Data) modems can support one or more of the following WWAN technology types:

* GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) is a modulation method used to enable data communications over GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) cellular networks. For the purposes of this discussion, the key characteristic of GPRS networks is the presence of a SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) Card to securely store the mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) number and its related key, which are used to identify and authenticate subscribers. Inserting a SIM Card allows basic cellular service (including voice and text messaging over a GSM network) to be established. However, cellular data service may require additional configuration that cannot be performed based solely on the information provided by the SIM Card.
* CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) is a modulation method used in many mobile phone standards such as cdmaOne, CDMA2000 (the 3G evolution of cdmaOne), and WCDMA. For the purposes of this discussion, the key characteristic of CDMA networks is the lack of a SIM Card. Lacking a SIM Card often meant that cellular service has to be activated through a manual process between the device user and the cellular provider. During this activation process, all services (voice, text messaging, and cellular data) were generally configured.
* LTE (Long-Term Evolution or 4G) is a modulation method that is a lends itself to the extension of both CDMA and GPRS into 4G. For the purposes of this discussion, the key characteristic of LTE networks is the presence of a SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) Card to securely store the mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) number and its related key, which are used to identify and authenticate subscribers. In addition, LTE SIM Cards contain additional information that generally allow cellular data service to be activated with the additional configuration that was often required for GPRS.

As noted above, devices that are operating on GSM networks, and that need to use GPRS cellular data over those networks, may need to perform additional configuration by providing information that cannot be obtained from the SIM Card. This required configuration is usually referred to as the APN (Access Point Name), although this is a bit of a misnomer since the configuration actually requires more than just the name of the Access Point. An APN identifies the packet data network (PDN) that a mobile data user wants to communicate with and may also define the type of service available. Configuring use of an APN by a device generally requires configuring the actual name of the Access Point as well as username and password information required to connect via that Access Point.

A GPRS-equipped Android device must generally have a suitable APN defined for each GPRS cellular data network that will be used. If only one GPRS cellular data network will be used, then only one APN will need to be defined. But if multiple GPRS cellular data network will need to be used (e.g. to support roaming amongst multiple geographical locations), then multiple APNs would need to be defined.

The GprsMgr Feature Type allows you to Add or Remove APNs from the set of defined APNs and set which APN is the default APN to which the device will automatically connect.
