title: Profiles and Plug-ins
description: Each app that uses DataWedge must be associated with a Profile, which contains Plug-ins for determining how the data will be acquired (using an input Plug-in), processed (with a process Plug-in) and delivered to the app (through an output Plug-in). Details about functionality and usage of each of the available Plug-ins can be found in the links below. For general details about how Profiles and Plug-ins work, see the Architecture Overview page.
