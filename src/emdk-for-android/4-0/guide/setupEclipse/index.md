---


## Installing Eclipse
1.	Go to [http://eclipse.org/downloads/](http://eclipse.org/downloads/).
2.	Download **Eclipse IDE for Java Developers** 3.7.2 (Indigo) or greater.
3.	Make a note of the name and location where you save the Eclipse on your system. You will need to refer to the  Eclipse directory later when installing EMDK for Android.

> NOTE: Eclipse 3.6 (Helios) is no longer supported with the latest version of ADT.

## Installing ADT Plugin to Eclipse
>NOTE: Since Google has released Android Studio, the ADT **Bundle** is no longer available for download. You will need to install Eclipse with the ADT **Plug-In** instead.

1.	Start Eclipse, then select **Help : Install New Software**.
2.	Click **Add**, in the top-right corner.
3.	In the Add Repository dialog that appears, enter **ADT Plugin** for the Name and the following URL for the Location: **https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/**

	> NOTE: The Android Developer Tools update site requires a secure connection. Make sure the update site URL you enter starts with HTTPS.
4.	Click **OK**.
5.	In the Available Software dialog, select the check box next to Developer Tools and click Next.
6.	In the next window, you'll see a list of the tools to be downloaded. **Click Next**.
7.	Read and accept the license agreements, then click **Finish**.

	> NOTE: If you get a security warning saying that the authenticity or validity of the software can't be established, click OK.
8.	When the installation completes, restart Eclipse.

>NOTE: EMDK for Android requires ADT v22.3.0-887826 or higher version.

## Installing Android SDK
1.	Go to [http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).
2.	Click on the hyperlink [Other Download Options](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Other) or scroll down towards the section **Other Download Options**.
3.	Look for the table under sub section **SDK Tools Only**.
4.	Click on the Package [installer_r24-windows.exe](http://dl.google.com/android/installer_r24-windows.exe) under Platform **Windows**.
5.	Accept the License Agreement.
6.	Click on the button **Download installer_r24-windows.exe**.
7.	Double-click the downloaded executable to start the installation.
8.	Make a note of the name and location where you save the Android SDK on your system, as you will need to refer to the standalone Android SDK directory later when installing EMDK for Android.


## Configuring the Android Developer Tools (ADT) for EMDK
The EMDK requires Android API's 16 and 19 to be Installed.

To check which API's you have installed:

1. In Eclipse go to **Window** then **Android SDK Manager**
2. Check that the status of **Android 1.1.2 (API 16)** and **Android  4.4.2 (API 19)** SDK Platforms status is **Installed**.
