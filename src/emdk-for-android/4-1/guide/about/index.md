## Components

### Profile Manager
The EMDK's exclusive [Profile Manager](/emdk-for-android/4-1/guide/profile-manager) Technology is an additional advantage for developers giving you a GUI based development tool built on our open framework. This allows you to write fewer lines of code resulting in reduced development time, effort and errors. This innovative feature not only gives you easy access to critical functions such as bar code scanning and transaction processing via a magnetic stripe reader (MSR) but also functionality not available in Google's Android SDK.   

### EMDK Device Runtime
In order for your application to use the EMDK For Android, you will need to install the EMDK Device Runtime on each device. This runtime is included with the EMDK For Android installation. Check the [Setup Guide](/emdk-for-android/4-1/guide/setupDevice) for instructions. In the future the EMDK Services will be included with the default operating system for the device.

### Samples & Programmer's Guide
There are sample projects that are included as part of the EMDK For Android installation. You can import the project into your IDE and run on your device. Look at the [Sample Guide](/emdk-for-android/4-1/samples/) for more details on using these samples. You can also reference the [Programmers Guide](/emdk-for-android/4-1/tutorial/) for a complete walk-through of building your first EMDK For Android application.

### Java APIs
The EMDK for Android offers access to the device's Barcode capabilities through [traditional native Java Barcode APIs](/emdk-for-android/4-1/api). Be sure to look at the [Barcode Scanning API tutorial.](/emdk-for-android/4-1/tutorial/tutBasicScanningAPI)

### Intent APIs
The EMDK for Android will continue to support the [DataCapture](/emdk-for-android/4-1/guide/reference/refdatacaptureintent) and [Battery Intent](/emdk-for-android/4-1/guide/reference/refbatteryintent) APIs that were previously available on individual device types.

* [API Reference](https://developer.motorolasolutions.com/community/android/emdk/reference) 
* [Profile Manager](https://developer.motorolasolutions.com/community/android/emdk/profiles)

**Q: Will my app run across the entire MSI android portfolio?**

A: EMDK for Android is designed to be compatible with all Symbol devices, Android OS and BSPs. However, the compatibility of your application will depend on not just the EMDK architecture, but also on Google's SDK. See above for what versions were validated.

**Q: Can the EMDK for Android be used as a staging tool?**

A: The EMDK for Android is targeted for developers and the development of applications. Customers may develop an application which configures aspects of a device however the EMDK is not a staging tool.

**Q: I understand the EMDK for Android offers a feature called Profile Manager, what is this?**

A: The Profile Manager is provided as an Eclipse plug-in that offers developers a GUI development tool. The tool creates a "profile" which is comprised of "profile features" defined by the developer for value-add capabilities such as Barcode Scanning & MSR as well as device configuration features like Clock, Power, Certificates and Application Access. These features can then be invoked and modified within the applications through the Profile Manager API.

**Q: What are the benefits of the Profile Manager GUI and API?**

A: The Profile Manager GUI and APIs allow you to, quickly and easily leverage device value-add features. The user interface makes it easy for developers to pick and choose the features they need, eliminating the need to code these options. With the Profile Manager API, developers can invoke and modify features as needed within their application. This gives you the fine level of control you need while reducing development time, effort and errors.

**Q: Does the EMDK for Android offer APIs for direct control of device value adds?**

A: Yes, the since version 3.0 of EMDK for Android, traditional Java APIs have been made available to provide Barcode scanning abilities. Other device value adds may be provided using this mechanism in the future.

**Q: I understand that the EMDK for Android supports Intents; what is an Intent?**

A: An Intent is a standard Android inter-application messaging mechanism. For more information please see Google's documentation on Android Intent; http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html

**Q: How does Mobility Extensions (MX) relate to the EMDK for Android?**

A: The EMDK for Android provides developers with a programmatic interface to the MX value-add features on our devices. Future releases of the EMDK for Android will offer additional features as we continue to expand MX capabilities.

**Q: I have started developed of my application with the EMDK for Android, what are the features of the EMDK and what are my alternatives?**

A: The EMDK for Android is designed to expose MX value-add features and provides developers with a GUI tool to help reduce the development effort. Many of the device specific features such as Barcode scanning and MSR will be provided as part of the EMDK for Android. However standard Android APIs from Google such as Audio and Keyboard will not.
 
The intent of the EMDK is to provide developers with commonly required programmatic features for Line of Business applications. The EMDK for Android is meant to be used alongside the Google Android SDK to provide developers a comprehensive set of features without having to have a signed application. Below is a list of key features and there availability within the EMDK for Android and Google's Android SDK. This is meant to be used as a reference guide to provide clarity on when to use the EMDK versus the Android SDK.
