The innovative TechDocs site employs numerous visionary technologies, some of which are obvious when looking at the site, and others that operate behind the scenes. For example, some of the visibility features: 

### Features
**Redirection –** This feature enables sales, marketing, product management, support and other Zebra departments to create links for printed materials and other collateral that always lead to the current version of a product and never go stale. 

**SmartDocs –** For Zebra’s Mobility DNA documentation, SmartDocs allows a user to enter the MX, OSX and/or Android version(s) on a device and see a list of the features and capabilities available on that device, helping to reduce development and troubleshooting guesswork. 

**Integrated Google Search –** Instantly delivers relevant results within any product to quickly find the required information.
