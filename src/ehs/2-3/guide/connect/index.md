basic understanding of the installation, configuration, usage and essential workings of EHS, and are recommended for anyone unfamiliar with first-time EHS setup. Please note that everything detailed here also can be automated through a Mobile Device Management (MDM) system and with direct manipulation of the EHS config file, which is documented in the [Advanced Settings]() section. 

> <b>Note</b>: Installation and setup requires that EHS be present on a PC or Mac that can communicate with the target device and write to all storage areas. If necessary, please [download EHS](/ehs/2-3/download) and [establish connectivity between the computer and device(s)](). Then resume from here. 

## Supported Devices and APKs
Enterprise Home Screen works with most Zebra Android devices. The EHS download package includes <b>all three files</b> indicated in the table below, plus documentation and release notes.

&#50;. <b>Copy the </b>`EHS_020300.apk` <b>file</b> from the PC to any writable device folder.


Remote uninstallation of EHS is now complete.
