This parm will allow you to specify the name of the action to be performed by the receiver(s) of the Intent. Many standard Android action names are predefined, but new action names can be added, making the set of possible action names effectively unlimited. A given receiver will likely honor only a small set of action names, so the action name to be used should be chosen from amongst those supported by the intended receiver(s).

>**Note:** Since the set of possible action names is extensible, the Intent does not put any specific restrictions on the action names that can be specified. However, Android rejects an Intent for which there is no suitable receiver. In addition, certain receivers may require certain permissions to be held by an application in order to send Intents with certain action names. If an attempt is made to send an Intent and that Intent is rejected by the Android system or by a specific receiver, then an error will be returned in the Result XML.
