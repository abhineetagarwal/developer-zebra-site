Enable the specified channels in the 5.0GHz band. In most cases, if the 5.0GHZ band is allowed to be used, then the channels in this band that should be used can be determined automatically through negotiation with the Wi-Fi infrastructure. However, it may be beneficial to control the channels manually because different channels or sets of channels might be used for different uses. It may be preferable to limit the devices to only use certain channels so that other channels are left for other purposes.

Parm value input rules:
