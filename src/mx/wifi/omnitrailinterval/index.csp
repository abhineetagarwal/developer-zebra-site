Used to specify the interval (in ms) at which to emit a locational beacon. 

surefrom 200-5000 ms, after which SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN. 

From Omnitrail docs: 
Mobile device 101 may modify the interval based on that determination. For example, if mobile device 101 determines that it has been brought into a bounded space (e.g., indoors), it may increase the interval to once every 100 milliseconds, and if it has been brought outside of a bounded space (e.g., outdoors), it may decrease the interval to once every 900 milliseconds.


**Parm value input rules**:
