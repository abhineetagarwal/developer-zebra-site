The AnalyticsMgr controls collection of data by the Analytics Engine in the form of groups of metrics.

Zebra Android devices are equipped with an Analytics Engine that can collect information pertaining to the operation and health of a device. Such data can be used to detect devices that need attention or potentially could be used to detect trends that could allow problems to be avoided through preventative action.

AnalyticsMgr also controls which data is collected and how often, and whether collected data is stored on the device or in the Cloud.

### Main Functionality
 
* Enable or Disable all data collection by the Analytics Engine
* Control whether data is stored locally on the device or is sent to the Cloud
