The Bug Report Manager (BugReportMgr) provides a framework for reporting the time and relevant technical data associated with perceived issues on Zebra mobile computers. Bug reports can be triggered programmatically through an intent or manually by an administrator or device user using the Power Key menu. Reports can be stored in internal memory or a removable memory card, sent to an e-mail address or uploaded to the Zebra Cloud for further analysis.
