Turning on Airplane Mode disables all radios, including the cellular radio, the Wi-Fi radio, and the Bluetooth radio. While Airplane Mode is turned off, radios other than the cellular radio can be turned back on individually. Turning off Airplane Mode turns on the cellular radio, but does not change the state of other radios.

>This parm allows you to select whether or not Airplane Mode should be allowed to be turned on or off from the Airplane Mode menu option in the Power Key Menu.
