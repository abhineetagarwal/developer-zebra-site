This parm allows you to control whether the Auto Correct function can be used to save commonly entered words and offer them as corrections to potentially mistyped words. Saving previously entered words and offering them as replacements for mistyped words could be seen as a security risk since it could expose sensitive information to visible inspection or re-entry by device users that are not authorized to possess or enter that information.
