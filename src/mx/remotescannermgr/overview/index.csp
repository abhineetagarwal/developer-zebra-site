The Remote Scanner Manager is used to monitor, configure and apply firmware updates to Zebra Bluetooth scanners connected to a device. Originally developed for Zebra's RS6000 Bluetooth Ring Scanner series, this functionality is now supported by most Zebra scanners, even if they're not paired with the device.
