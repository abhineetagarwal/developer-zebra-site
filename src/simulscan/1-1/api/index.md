## Overview
There are two ways to use SimulScan with a custom application written by an enterprise. 

###1. Through DataWedge
**The easiest way to use SimulScan is to activate it from within** [DataWedge](../../../../datawedge), a free app on all Zebra Android devices that acquires data using the device's camera or scanner and passes that data to the app. [Setup](../guide/setup) can be done in just a few minutes, and provides capabilities adequate for many use cases. 

###2. Through SimulScan APIs 

FOR SITUATIONS THAT ARE THIS AND THAT...

**The other way is to call SimulScan APIs directly** from within an Android app. SimulScan APIs (depicted below) are accessed from within [EMDK for Android](../../../../emdk-for-android), Zebra's development environment for building Android applications. **Click on the image below to <u>leave SimulScan docs</u> and** [open EMDK's SimulScan APIs](http://zebra-stage.github.io/emdk-for-android/6-0/api/reference/com/symbol/emdk/simulscan/package-summary.html).
