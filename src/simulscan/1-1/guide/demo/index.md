##Overview
A Demo App is included with all [devices that support SimulScan](../about/#supporteddevices) and is intended to quickly demonstrate how SimulScan works and what it can do. The Demo App also provides a way to test custom templates that implement multi-barcode, signature capture, Optical Character Recognition OCR, and Optical Mark Recognition (OMR, i.e. checkboxes) for SimulScan Readable Forms.

**The Demo App cannot save data and is not suitable for production environments**.   

###Demo App features

* Form Recognition and capture
* Multi-Barcode scanning on a structured form
* Multi-Barcode scanning on an unstructured form
* OCR (Single- and multi-line options for alphanumeric characters)
* Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) for checkboxes
* Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) for passports and other travel documents

<!--
To help users become familiar with the demo app, we've created a video playlist. We've also included several templates for easy use. To give you an idea of the functionality, we've built templates for two forms that should be printed for use with the demo app. By printing the forms, users will get a first hand look at how SimulScan works.
