DEMO APP & DEMO TEMPLATES
Supported devices all come preinstalled with a simple SimulScan demo application intended to help users get a quick idea of SimulScan functionality.
The demo app showcases many different capabilities and provides a way to test custom templates that include multi-barcode, OCR (optical character recognition), signature capture, and OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) for SimulScan Readable Forms.
 
To help users become familiar with the demo app, we've created a video playlist. We've also included several templates for easy use. To give you an idea of the functionality, we've built templates for two forms that should be printed for use with the demo app. By printing the forms, users will get a first hand look at how SimulScan works.
