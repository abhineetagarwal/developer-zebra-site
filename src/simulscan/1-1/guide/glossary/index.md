**Anchor Element(s) -** one or more unchanging images, barcodes or other Document attributes (i.e. company logo) created as part of a Template that SimulScan can use to identify a Document and determine its orientation. 

**Bounding Box -** an oval, round or square object on the printed form that contains a mark to be acquired using OMR. 

**Data Type -** defines the source (barcode, OCR, etc.) of data being acquired from a Region of a Document.

**Document -** printed form containing data to be acquired (i.e. a shipping receipt). Documents should be associated with no more than one Template.

**Field-** see Region Field.

**Fixed layout-** a Document with a layout that doesn't change from one instance to another. Also known as a Structured Target. 

**Form Region of Interest -** the area inside the outer-most border of a Document that contains Field Regions of Interest with data to be acquired.   

**Grouped Regions -** refers to sections of a Document that require Fields (i.e. an address) to be grouped logically as an aid to processing the acquired data. 

**Image -** See Picture. 

**Input Plug-in -** defines in a DataWedge Profile the means by which data is acquired by DataWedge. See [SimulScan Input](../../../../datawedge/6-0/guide/setup/#simulscaninput). 

**Mixed Data-type -** a Template that captures multiple data types from mixed sources, such as barcodes, alpha/numeric characters, checkboxes and images. 

**Multi-barcode -** a Template that captures only barcode data. 

**Multi-Line -** acquisition using OCR of multiple lines of alpha/numeric characters (i.e. a complete address).

**Multi-Template -** allows multiple Templates to be treated as one to simplify deployment and workflow. 

**OCR -** Optical Character Recognition, a processing mode for acquiring alpha/numeric characters. Currently supports English, French, German, Spanish and Portuguese. 

**OMR -** Optical Mark Recognition, a processing mode for acquiring binary (present/not present) data from checkboxes. Also includes an "undecided" state. 

**Picture -** graphical image to be acquired as a file (i.e. `.jpg` file). Minimum image size: 128 x 128 pixels; maximum: 2600 x 2000 pixels.  

**Region Field of Interest-** area of a form within a Form Region of Interest that is associated with a data type and processing method (i.e. a barcode). Also referred to as a "Field." 

**Secure Storage -** the online area accessible only by credentialed user(s) in which Templates are stored. 

**Signature -** generally of the recipient of a shipment (captured as an image).

**SimulScanRegion -** name of the Java object that references a SimulScan Region Field.   

**Single-Line -** acquisition using OCR of a single line of alpha/numeric characters (i.e. a product number).

**Target, Structured -** a Document with a layout that doesn't change from one instance to another. Such targets are referred to as having a fixed layout. 

**Target, Unstructured -** a Document with no fixed layout, or a Document that has not been defined with a Template.

**Template -** an XML document that defines "regions of interest" on Documents to be scanned, "fields of interest" within those regions, and the type of data (barcode, text, etc.) to be extracted from the fields. Each Template is associated with exactly one Document. 

**Template, Structured -** a Template made for a Structured Target and generally associated with Mixed Data-type mode. Work on the principle that location and type of data in each field of a form (i.e. barcodes, alphanumeric characters, signatures, etc.) will remain consistent whenever the form is used. Use the device cameraÂ by default.  

**Template, Unstructured -** generally used for Unstructured Targets and when acquiring data of a single type. The device imager is automatically selected for Barcode-only mode; the camera for OCR.  

<!-- 
**Template Persistence -** keeps Templates in sync between a development host and the Template Builder host server. 
-->

**Validation -** checks whether the Fields and their properties are correct for a given Document before a Template is deployed to devices. 

**Well-defined Border -** the area surrounding a Target Document that contains: 1) a single, unbroken perimeter that defines the form, 2) a solid frame with a minimum 20% contrast from the target, 3) a minimum 5% margin between the Document and its outer-most border (see examples below).

_Well-defined borders provide an unbroken perimeter as well as space and contrast from surrounding areas_.
