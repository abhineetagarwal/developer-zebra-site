## Overview
The ability to scan as many as nine (9) barcodes simultaneously the Multi-barcode feature is included free with all devices that support SimulScan, provided the scans are performed through an app that uses [DataWedge](../../../../datawedge) (which is also free). **A SimulScan license is required for each device to unlock SimulScan's advanced features**, such as optical character recognition (OCR), optical mark recognition (OMR) and Multi-barcode for 10 or more barcodes at a time. A license also is required to use [SimulScan APIs](../../api) to access SimulScan directly from within an app or from [Enterprise Browser](../../../../enterprise-browser).  

**A license is NOT required to use the [SimulScan Demo App](../demo)**.

## Demo License
Demo Licenses are available for customers evaluating SimulScan, and for developers that are about to begin integrating SimulScan into their applications. To request a demo license to enable the SimulScan functionality and enable the programming interfaces on a device, please email NMV386@zebra.com with the subject header, "SimulScan Demo License Request."

Demo licenses are generally sent within one business day of being requested.

Device License

SimulScan is sold today as a device license. Licenses may be purchased from a Zebra Technologies product reseller. Once a license is purchased or a demo license is requested, an email will be sent to the customer with a username and password to the Software Licensing Portal (https://softwarelicensing.zebra.com/).

In order to gain access to the licensing website, you must be given a login and allocated licenses by an administrator. Website documentation and navigation help can be found on the website's documentation site at https://softwarelicensing.zebra.com/documentation/index.html

Licenses can be purchased for a specific device based on the product name and serial number or for larger deployments using the Deployment key that can be generated on the licensing website.

Applying a License

Licenses can be deployed and installed in one of the two ways:
1. Directly onto each device by copying the SDC_License.xml file downloaded from the licensing server to an accessible location on the device. Then, launch the Settings app, click on About Phone â€“> Legal Information -> Symbol Licenses -> Menu -> Install license -> point to the file on the device.
2. Using StageNow for larger deployments. StageNow has a special wizard to help in creating a mass deployment configuration for SimulScan using the deployment key generated from the licensing website. Once deployed on the device via SimulScan, the licenses are automatically installed. For more details, please refer StageNow's documentation

*Please note that a license will need to be redeployed to a device after a factory reset. Factory resets clear the license from the device.
