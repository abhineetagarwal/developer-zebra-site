ABOUT SIMULSCAN DOCUMENT CAPTURE
With this powerful image capture technology, you can take process automation to the next level and achieve substantial increases in worker efficiency, processing accuracy and cycle times. When SimulScan is incorporated in your Android devices, workers can capture the contents of an entire form in a single scan — including bar codes, text fields, phone numbers, images, signatures, and even check boxes — and instantly auto-populate business forms with that information.

SimulScan is an end-to-end data capture solution for extracting critical data from documents.

Benefits:
- Productivity gains by decoding multiple barcodes with a single scan (Multi-Barcode)
- Automated data entry with character recognition (OCR)
- Simplified workflow exceptions with checked mark recognition (OMR) and Signature presence detection

SIMULSCAN FUNDAMENTALS
SimulScan was built to digitize data. It was developed to fulfill two fundamental use cases:

1. Digitize one or multiple “data fields” structured in a specific and consistent way on a form or label.
Simply put, the form below is an example of a structured form. The data on the form will change, but the location of each data field (barcode, alphanumeric characters, signature, etc) is fix – it does not move. Because the location of each data field does not move, users can create a SimulScan “Template” allowing them to capture and correctly identify every field on the form below in one scan. The Template allows a developer to uniquely identify each data field, enabling the ability to input each field of data into fields within the workers application. This means that SimulScan can capture (1) barcode information, (2) printed text (addresses, names and account numbers), (3) checked boxes, and (4) and an image of the signature seamlessly.

2. Digitize a single type of data (i.e. multiple barcodes) or a single data field (i.e. an address) that may or may not be on a structured form.

Simply put, you may not want to capture an entire form, or the form/label might not have a clear structure. For those situations, we’ve enabled the ability to create a Template specific to the SimulScan feature that is needed. For example, a SimulScan “Template” can be created for OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to capture an address on a form. Another Template can be created to capture two or more barcodes in a single scan. Another Template can be created to capture the MRZ data from travel documents. These are all examples of when only one type of data (multiple barcodes, Character Recognition) needs to be captured and digitized without the need to identify the location of specific data field on a form or label.
