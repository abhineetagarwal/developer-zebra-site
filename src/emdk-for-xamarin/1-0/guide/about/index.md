### About version numbers
With this release, we wanted to bring all the EMDK tools into your selected IDE. To do that we leveraged the extension framework provided by Visual studio and Xamarin Studio. The Visual Studio Extension and Xamarin Studio Add-in are separate IDE plug-ins that may have different version numbers and may not match the EMDK for Xamarin Component version. Below is a list of each plug-in version number along with the version number of the EMDK for Xamarin component they deliver.

Microsoft Visual Studio Extension **v1.0.4**: ( Provides EMDK menu in Visual Studio )

* EMDK for Xamarin Component **v1.0.3** ( Provides C# EMDK API's )

Xamarin Studio Add-in **v1.0.5**: (Provides EMDK menu in Xamarin Studio )

* EMDK for Xamarin Component **v1.0.3** ( Provides C# EMDK API's )

##Devices Supported
Currently only Zebra Android KitKat devices are supported. Be sure to run the [device update](/emdk-for-xamarin/1-0/guide/deviceupdate) on all devices before using the EMDK for Xamarin.
