## Notes

****** DO NOT MERGE THIS BRANCH BACK INTO THE MAIN BRANCHES ********

- All source is inside MDMTK 2.0 folder with exception of anything we need to re-use like MX
- For MX we use Markdown notation like EMDK uses (so stays in context of MDMTK)
- The Header and Layout were modified to not load the analytics, sumome, etc


## Building for electron

1) build mdm_mdmtk
2) cd electron-with-express
3) electron .
