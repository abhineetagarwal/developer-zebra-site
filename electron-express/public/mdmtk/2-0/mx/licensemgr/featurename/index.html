        <p>This parm allows you to specify the Standard Licensed Feature Name against which you want to verify the Software License File.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> At present, there is only one defined Standard Licensed Feature Name, for SimulScan. Selecting it will avoid the need to enter the exact value of the Licensed Feature Name for SimulScan. In the future, as new Standard Licensed Feature Names are added, the list will be expanded to make those Licensed Feature Names easier to verify. If you acquire a Software License File that is associated with some other Licensed Feature Name, use "Verify against a custom feature name" instead so you can enter the specific Licensed Feature Name for the Software License File you acquired.</p>
