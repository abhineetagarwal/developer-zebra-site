        <p>The name of the certificate alias that should be used to join the network (Optional). When Authenticating using EAP types other than EAP-TLS, which would not require a client certificate, a client is still allowed. If used, the client certificate will be used to authenticate the device to the authentication server as part of the establishment of the secure tunnel over which further authentication credentials will be delivered. This means that the client certificate do not need to be unique, even if the authentication credentials are. The use of a client certificate can introduce an additional level of protection by requiring a device to possess a valid client certificate as well as valid authentication credentials. The client certificate serves as a first pass filter.</p>
