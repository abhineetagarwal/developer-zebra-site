        <p>Specify the type of encryption key to be used by the network. This key is only specified when the Security Mode is "Personal" since the "Open" Security Mode does not use encryption and the "Enterprise" Security Mode distributes keys automatically following Authentication.</p>

<p>An encryption key can be specified using one of two methods: </p>

<ul>
<li>A hexadecimal value of the actual key</li>

<li>A passphrase that can be used to generate a key using a pre-defined algorithm</li>
</ul>

<p>The method that is used usually depends on the configuration of the Wi-Fi infrastructure that implements the network. This is because the key to be used must be known to both the Wi-Fi infrastructure and the client. Therefore, both must use a common method to specify that key.</p>
