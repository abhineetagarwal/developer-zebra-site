        <p>Specifies the state of the Wi-Fi radio when the device suspends.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For Android devices, the device is suspended when the display turns off after idling for a certain amount of time. While the device is suspended, the device's software continues running in a lower power mode, meaning that the device itself is not turned off and software can run when the device is in this state. The amount of power consumption while in this state partially depends on what features are left on.</p>
