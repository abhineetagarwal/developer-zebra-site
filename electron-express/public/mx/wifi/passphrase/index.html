        <p>This enables encryption of the Key. </p>

<p>When Key Type is Passphrase, then a Passphrase needs to be specified so it can be used to generate a Key. The type of Passphrase required will vary with the WPA Mode specified since it need to be either a WEP Passphrase or a WPA Passphrase.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Currently, the parm value encryption process is not documented and the key that is needed to encrypt is not published. Therefore, an MDM cannot currently use encrypted Keys or Passphrases since there is no way to store an encrypted, server-supplied password in an XML.</p>
