        <p>When selected, a Proxy is used for network connections. You can either manually configure the proxy settings or select the location of a PAC file for automatic configuration. A proxy is a an intermediary service that routes HTTP requests and responses between clients on a device and another network (typically the internet or an intranet). When there is a proxy between the Wi-Fi network and some outer network, then HTTP-based applications, such as a Web Browser, may need to negotiate with that proxy to access the services of that outer network.</p>
