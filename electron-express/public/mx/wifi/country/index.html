        <p>Sets the country to use for Wi-Fi regulatory setting. </p>

<p>When you choose 'AUTO' in the drop-down, 802.11d will be enabled. 802.11d is a mode where the device will listen for a country-specific beacon. It also will not transmit unless it can auto-detect the country, which can be beneficial because the device cannot transmit with a frequency that is inconsistent with the Wi-Fi infrastructure and is therefore less likely to violate country-specific regulations.</p>

<p>If a Wi-Fi infrastructure does not support, 802.11d, then the country that is used by this infrastructure will need to be selected so that the device can connect to it.</p>
