        <p>This is used to manage the Wi-Fi network profiles on the device. A given device can have zero or more Wi-Fi network profiles defined, which are used to specify the information that is needed for the device to connect to a single Wi-Fi network. These profiles can each be enabled or disabled. An enabled Wi-Fi network profile can be used to connect to a network and a disabled profile cannot be used to connect to a network. At any given time, the device can be connected to at most one network using a corresponding Wi-Fi network profile. The potential network connections are controlled by which profiles are defined and enabled on the device. It is also possible to force a connection to the network associated with a specific Wi-Fi network profile.</p>
