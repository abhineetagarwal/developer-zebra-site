        <p>This parm allows you to control whether the use of the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) Mode will be allowed. When allowed, a PC could be connected to the device via a USB port that supports Peripheral mode or via an OTG USB port. ADB is a line tool that allows communication between the PC and the Android device and can be used to copy files, install apps, run shell commands, etc. Use of ADB could represent a security risk since it could be used as a path to extract sensitive data from a device, to inject unwanted data or applications into a device, or to remove or modify the operation of important applications on a device.</p>
