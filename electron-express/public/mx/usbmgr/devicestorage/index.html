        <p>This parm allows you to control whether the use of all direct methods of access device storage from PC via USB is allowed. This controls the use of USB Mass Storage (UMS), Media Transfer Protocol (MTP), and Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) but does not control the use of ADB mode, which can be controlled separately. When these modes are allowed, a PC could be connected to the device via a USB port that supports Peripheral mode or via an OTG USB port. Once connected, such a PC could browse exposed portions of the device file system, copy files to or from the device, delete files, etc. Use of these modes could represent a security risk since it could be used as a path to extract sensitive data from a device, to inject unwanted data or applications into a device, or to delete important information from a device.</p>
