        <p>This parm allows you to control whether the use of Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) is allowed. When this mode is allowed, a PC could be connected to the device via a USB port that supports Peripheral mode or via an OTG USB port. Once connected, such a PC could browse exposed portions of the device file system, copy files to or from the device, or delete files. Use of this mode could represent a security risk since it could be used as a path to extract sensitive data from a device, to inject unwanted data or applications into a device, or to delete important information from a device.</p>
