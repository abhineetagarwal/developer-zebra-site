        <p>Some Zebra Android devices provide the ability to boot into a Safe Mode. Safe Mode is typically used to perform troubleshooting operations that might be impeded by certain applications or services that would normally start when booting the device normally. Since booting into Safe Mode could render the operation of the device insecure and likely would impact the ability of the device to perform its production functions, it may be desirable to prevent device users from booting into Safe Mode under normal circumstances.</p>

<p>This parm allows you to select whether or not Safe Mode should be allowed to be turned on or off from the Safe Mode menu option in the Power Key Menu.</p>
