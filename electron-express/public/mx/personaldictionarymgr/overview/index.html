        <p>Personal Dictionary Manager is used to administer changes to the custom word repository used by Zebra's <a href="../enterprisekeyboardmgr">Enterprise Keyboard</a>. This includes the addition and deletion of individual words and phrases, assignment of shortcuts and the erasure of all saved data. The Auto-correction and Suggestion capabilities of Enterprise Keyboard allow words and phrases saved in the Personal Dictionary to appear as spelling corrections for words being typed.</p>

<p>Similarly, the Shortcut feature allows words or phrases to be assigned a shortcut of one or more letters that can be automatically replaced with the corresponding word or phrase. This can be useful for storing industry terms to help improve the speed and accuracy of keyboard input. For example, if configuring a medical device, the phrase "gastroesophageal reflux disease" could be added to the dictionary and assigned the shortcut "gerd," which would be replaced with the longer term any time gerd was typed. </p>
