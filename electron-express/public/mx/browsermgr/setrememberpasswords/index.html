        <p>This parm will allow you to turn the Remember Passwords Option of the Default Android Web Browser On or Off.</p>

<p>Turning the Remember Passwords Option On can make browsing more convenient by eliminating the need for the device user to enter the same password later. Turning the Remember Passwords Option Off is generally more secure, especially on a device that might be shared, since it would prevent an unauthorized user from logging in using a password that was previously entered by an authorized user.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This feature has been depreciated from KitKat onwards. This is available on Jelly Bean devices.</p>
