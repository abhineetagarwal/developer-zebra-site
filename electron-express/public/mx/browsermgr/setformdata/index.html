        <p>This parm will allow you to turn the Save Form Data Option of the Default Android Web Browser On or Off.</p>

<p>Turning the Save Form Data Option On can make browsing more convenient by eliminating the need for the device user to re-enter the same information into the same form later. Turning the Save Form Data Option Off is generally more secure, especially on a device that might be shared, since it would prevent an unauthorized user viewing or re-entering sensitive information that was previously entered by an authorized user.</p>
