        <p>Used to specify which Key Code will be sent as the Key Behavior for the specified Key in various Key State Mapping Tables. All of these parms use the same values shown in the table of values provided for the Base Key State Mapping Table.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> All these parms also allow you to control the Key State(s) in which the Key Code will be sent. The parms used to control that are covered later in the Advanced Sections. If an attempt is made to specify a Key Behavior for a Key Mapping Table that is not supported on a given device, then an error will be returned in the Result XML. Consult the documentation for a specific device for information on the Key Mapping Tables supported on that device. Alternately, you can query the KeyMappingMgr to acquire a list of all Key Mapping Tables that are supported on that device.</p>
