        <p>Used to identify the Key for which Override Key Mapping will be added or modified. To add or modify Override Mappings for a Key, a parm value must be specified that contains a Key Identifier that is listed in the following table.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong> Not all devices support Keys that correspond to every Key Identifier listed in the table. If an attempt is made to add an Override Mapping to a Key Mapping Table for a Key that is not supported on a device, then an error will be returned in the Result XML. Consult the documentation for a specific device for information on the Keys supported on that device. Alternately, query the KeyMappingMgr to acquire a list of all Key Identifiers that are supported on that device.</p>
