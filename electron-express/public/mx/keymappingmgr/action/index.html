        <p>Controls whether to return Key Mapping to the default state or to add/modify Override Key Mappings for a single Key to one or more Key Mapping Tables.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> To configure a device with a prior state that is not known, it may be advisable to begin by returning Key Mapping to the default state. In that way, subsequently added Override Key Mappings will be starting from a known state and are therefore more likely to achieve a desired result. However, if the intention is to define a set of Key Mappings that are required by a specific application, it may be desirable to start from the current state (whatever that state might be) and alter it by adding or modifying selected Override Key Mappings without otherwise altering the state of Key Mapping for the device.</p>
