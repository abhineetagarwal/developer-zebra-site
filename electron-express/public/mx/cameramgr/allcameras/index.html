<p><strong>Important:</strong> Enabling or disabling all cameras will affect all mechanisms classified as cameras on a device. This will be the case even if that device has more cameras than can be individually controlled on the device using the CameraMgr. For example, if a device is equipped with a front- and rear-facing cameras and a side-facing imager that can capture documents, all three devices would be classified as cameras, and would therefore be enabled or disabled together using this parm. In this case, the side-facing imager could never be controlled individually; it must always be controlled with all other "cameras" and can be isolated with CameraMgr only by using parms that control the front- and rear-facing cameras. Enabling or disabling all cameras might override a prior such command by an individual camera app or might be overridden for individual cameras by subsequent commands by apps using the CameraMgr. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cameras and other imaging devices enabled or disabled previously by CameraMgr will remain in that state until explicitly commanded to do otherwise. </p>
