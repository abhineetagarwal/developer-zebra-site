        <p>The PowerMgr allows an app to perform power-related actions on the device, such as putting it into Sleep mode, rebooting the device or performing an OS Update. The action will be performed when the configuration is set.</p>

<p>PowerMgr performs only actions; there are currently no queries supported other than the ability to query the version of the CSP that implements PowerMgr itself.</p>
