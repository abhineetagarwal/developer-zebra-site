<p>A TFTP (Trivial File Transport Protocol) Server provides simple means for a remote client to get or put a file. A primary use of TFTP is configuring a device when it first joins a network. TFTP is used because it is very simple to implement but must be used with caution because it lacks security and other more advanced file transfer features.</p>

<p>This parm allows you to control whether a request for a TFTP Server Name will be sent by the DHCP Client to the DHCP Server in the DHCP Request. When requested, the DHCP Server will return the TFTP Server Name to the device in the DHCP Acknowledgment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The DHCP Client does not automatically use the TFTP Server Name to perform any file transfers or configuration. To configure a device using TFTP, the TFTP Server Name would need to be acquired using the DhcpOptionMgr and then provided to a TFTP Client that could perform the transfer of one or more files and then perform any desired configuration using those files.</p>
